# Notes for me

## Notes on next steps

- extend the hard-coded example to handle the case where multiple services use the same event as input
- extend the generated example to the same effect
- extend the hard-coded example to handle the case where a service can output different event types as result
- explore ways to provide better error descriptions

## Notes for things to consider in general

- services consuming/producing different events
- async (see whether it causes problems with the macro)
