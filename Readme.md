# Notes for me

## Notes on next steps

- extract events into an own crate
- extract services into an own crate
- create one crate for hard-coding
- create one crate for generting stuff via macro
- create one crate for the macro

## Notes for things to consider in general

- services consuming/producing different events
- async (see whether it causes problems with the macro)
